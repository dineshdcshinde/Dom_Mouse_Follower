## How It Works

1. **HTML**: Each container includes a heading and an initially hidden image.
2. **CSS**: Images are styled with circular shapes, transitions, and positioned absolutely within their containers.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - The image's visibility is toggled on `mousemove` and `mouseleave` events.
   - The cursor's position is tracked and used to position the image dynamically within the container.
